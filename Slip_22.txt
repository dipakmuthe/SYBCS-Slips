Q1.Implement a linear queue library (st_queue.h) of integers using a static 
implementation of the queue and implementing the operations like init (Q), 
AddQueue(Q, x) and X=DeleteQueue(Q). Write a program that includes queue 
library and calls different queue operations. [10]

Q2. Read the data from file 'cities.txt' containing names of cities and their STD 
codes. Accept a name of the city from user and use sentinel linear search 
algorithm to check whether the name is present in the file and output the STD 
code, otherwise output “city not in the list”. [20]
